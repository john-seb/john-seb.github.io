## Journal Articles

### Traversing a Thin Lubricant Film in Finite Time  
This work investigates how particles overcome a thin-film hydrodynamic barrier to make contact, with relevance to lubrication, adhesion, and interfacial transport problems.

- *John Sebastian*  
- Topic: thin-film hydrodynamics, dissipation barriers, scaling laws  
- Link: Available on my website publication page

---

### Electrical-Circuit Models for Nanofluidic Transport  
A reduced-order modeling approach for nanofluidic systems, using circuit analogies to connect experimental behavior with mechanistic understanding.

- Topic: nanofluidics, confinement-driven transport  
- Link: Listed under publications on my homepage

---

## Applied / Device-Oriented Work

### Impedance-Based Detection of Microplastics in Inland Waters  
A physics-driven sensing direction aimed at building low-cost, field-deployable approaches for identifying microplastics in environmental samples.

- Topic: frugal microfluidics, impedance spectroscopy  
- Link: Project description available on my site

## Preprints and Ongoing Work

I am currently exploring several questions at the interface of:

- geometry-driven transport  
- interfacial flows and thin films  
- soft and architectured materials  
- reduced-order modeling for complex physical systems  

Updates and manuscripts in preparation will be added here.
