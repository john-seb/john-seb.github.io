Using the framework of lubrication theory, which posits that drag force scales inversely with the film thickness, we explore how particles can achieve finite-time contact despite theoretical predictions of infinite time under constant force. We conduct experiments where a spherical particle settles under gravity and magnetic attraction, the latter introducing a spatially varying force. Our findings reveal that a spatially varying force significantly alters the settling trajectory, enabling finite-time contact. The results are supported by a simple model that links hydrodynamic drag and the impact of spatially varying forces. Finally, we illustrate that forces can be inferred from kinematic observations. In the future, this may provide insights into biological and microscale systems where direct force measurements are challenging. Our study demonstrates that varying forces can be harnessed to overcome lubrication barriers, offering potential applications in designing self-assembly systems and improving surface interaction processes.\n","date":1722988800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1722988800,"objectID":"e30b4a375fcfb118f7e2e8c2724f2cc6","permalink":"https://john-seb.github.io/publication/balls/","publishdate":"2024-08-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/balls/","section":"publication","summary":"J  Sebastian, A L Schødt, K H Jensen","tags":["Fluid Mechanics"],"title":"Traversing a thin lubricant film in finite time","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Featured on the [cover page](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/apxr.202370020) of the issue! Nanofluidic systems exhibit transport characteristics that have made technological marvels such as desalination, energy harvesting, and highly sensitive biomolecule sensing possible by virtue of their ability to influence small currents due to the selective transport of ions. Traditionally many of these applications have relied on the use of nanoporous membranes. The immense complexities of membrane geometry often impede a comprehensive understanding of the underlying physics. To bypass the associated difficulties, here we consider the much simpler nanochannel array comprised of numerous nanochannels and elucidate the effects of interchannel interactions on the Ohmic response of the array. We demonstrate that a nanochannel array is equivalent to an array of mutually independent but identical unit-cells whereby the array can be represented by an equivalent electrical circuit of unit-cell resistances connected in a parallel configuration. We show that the total resistance of the system scales inversely to the number of channels. We further deconstruct the unit-cell to be a combination of multiple contributing resistances connected in series. We validate the theoretical model underlying these electrical abstractions using numerical simulations and experiments. Our approach to modeling realistic nanofluidic systems by their equivalent electrical circuit provides an invaluable tool for analyzing and interpreting experimental measurements, characterization of surface charge properties of newly developed materials, and a method for the design and development of function-specific nanofluidic devices.

To my surprise, I found that this works. I managed to get a quick PhD — though when I got it I knew almost nothing about physics. But I did learn one big thing: that no one knows everything, and you don’t have to. While you are swimming and not sinking you should aim for rough water. My advice is to go for the messes — that’s where the action is. Forgive yourself for wasting time. In the real world, it’s very hard to know which problems are important, and most of the time that you spend in the laboratory or at your desk will be wasted. If you want to be creative, then you will have to get used to spending most of your time not being creative, to being becalmed on the ocean of scientific knowledge. Learn something about the history of science, or at a minimum the history of your own branch of science. As a scientist, you’re probably not going to get rich. Your friends and relatives probably won’t understand what you’re doing. But you can get great satisfaction by recognizing that your work in science is a part of history.

If it were so, I would have converted each of the above list entries to the fonts they represent.\n2 Toc - Table of Contents  the toggle word for toc is yes and not true in RMarkdown  2.1 Indentation  the following script will take care of indentation in the toc list:  \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; $(document).ready(function() { $items = $('div#TOC li'); $items.each(function(idx) { num_ul = $(this).parentsUntil('#TOC').length; $(this).css({'text-indent': num_ul * 10, 'padding-left': 0}); }); }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;   Use number_sections: true in the header for numbering.
