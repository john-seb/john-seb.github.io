      <title>Electrical Circuit Modelling of Nanofluidic Systems</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nanofluidic systems exhibit transport characteristics that have made technological marvels such as desalination, energy harvesting, and highly sensitive biomolecule sensing possible by virtue of their ability to influence small currents due to the selective transport of ions. Traditionally many of these applications have relied on the use of nanoporous membranes. The immense complexities of membrane geometry often impede a comprehensive understanding of the underlying physics. To bypass the associated difficulties, here we consider the much simpler nanochannel array comprised of numerous nanochannels and elucidate the effects of interchannel interactions on the Ohmic response of the array. We demonstrate that a nanochannel array is equivalent to an array of mutually independent but identical unit-cells whereby the array can be represented by an equivalent electrical circuit of unit-cell resistances connected in a parallel configuration. We show that the total resistance of the system scales inversely to the number of channels. We further deconstruct the unit-cell to be a combination of multiple contributing resistances connected in series. We validate the theoretical model underlying these electrical abstractions using numerical simulations and experiments. Our approach to modeling realistic nanofluidic systems by their equivalent electrical circuit provides an invaluable tool for analyzing and interpreting experimental measurements, characterization of surface charge properties of newly developed materials, and a method for the design and development of function-specific nanofluidic devices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Traversing a thin lubricant film in finite time</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this study, we investigate the dynamics of particles overcoming the hydrodynamic barrier posed by a thin fluid film to achieve contact in finite time, a phenomenon critical in various natural and engineered processes such as enzyme docking, catalysis, and vesicular transport. Using the framework of lubrication theory, which posits that drag force scales inversely with the film thickness, we explore how particles can achieve finite-time contact despite theoretical predictions of infinite time under constant force. We conduct experiments where a spherical particle settles under gravity and magnetic attraction, the latter introducing a spatially varying force. Our findings reveal that a spatially varying force significantly alters the settling trajectory, enabling finite-time contact. The results are supported by a simple model that links hydrodynamic drag and the impact of spatially varying forces. Finally, we illustrate that forces can be inferred from kinematic observations. In the future, this may provide insights into biological and microscale systems where direct force measurements are challenging. Our study demonstrates that varying forces can be harnessed to overcome lubrication barriers, offering potential applications in designing self-assembly systems and improving surface interaction processes.&lt;/p&gt;
