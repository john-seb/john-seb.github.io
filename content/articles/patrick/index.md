## Ability to communicate

***"We are storytelling animals"***

Students shouldn't go out without the ability to communicate for success in life depends on 
+ ability to speak
+ ability to write
+ quality of ideas

***in that order***

Quality of communication  depends on 
+ Knowledge in this area
+ practising what you know
+ inherent talent

***in that order***: what matters most is what you know!

**Rule on engagement**     
"Could you close that laptop please?" -  humans have only one language processer.

## Armament

### How to start?

- Start with a Joke? I don't recommend it!
  - People are adjusting in, and are not ready for a joke.
  - Start with an "empowerment promise"
    - "At the end of this 60 minutes......."
    - Express how stuff you're going to talk about is cool! 
  
  - How do you inspire people?
    - Everyone was inspired when they exhibited ***passion about what they are doing***!
    
#### 4 Samples of Heuristics
  - **Cycle** around about the course of the talk 
    - 20% of the listeners may be fogged out at a given time. So repeating it in a cycle, 3 times can convey it to most of the audience
  - Build a **Fence* around your idea, so that people don't assume it to be something else
  - **Verbal Punctuation**- to bring people back into the bus
    - To bring prople who fogged out back into the loop, give an overview now an then (a status update of sorts)
  - **Ask a Question**
    - Wait for 7 seconds for an answer
    - question shouldn't be too obvious - people will be embarrassed to answer
    - question shouldn't be too hard - nobody will have anything to say

*Build up your personal repertoire by observing your favourite speakers*

### Time and Place
- Time: do not coincide with food or sleep
- Place: 
  - Well lit
    -'It's extremely difficult to see slides through closed eyelids'
  - the place should be cased
    - like you're going to rob a bank
    - the hall should be reasonably populated
      - Right sized place that looks more than half full

### Boards and Chalk
- **Blackboards and Chalk** is the tool for *informing/teaching/lecturing*; slides are for *exposing*
  - Writing has a graphic quality
  - speed with which you write on the board is approx. how fast people can grasp
  - the board acts as a *targer*
    - Hands in the pocket or back?
      - Big NO
      - Extraordinarily insulting in many cultures
      - "looks like you are concealing a weapon"
    - with the board, you have something to do with your hands, something to point at

### Slides
  - ***They shouldn't take attention away from the speaker***
    - Fewer words- when there's too mush to read, "I wish you hadn't talked much, it was very distracting"
  - De-clutter:
    - Get rid of the logos
    - Get rid of the titles
    - Get rid of the bullets and dots
  - Laser pointers or any pointers for that matter take away attention and eye contact with the audience
    - "You know what, we could all leave and he still wouldn't know"
    - Use arrows or marks in the slides instead of using a pointer
  - Speaker should be close to the slides

### Props
- Talks are like plays!
  - Use objects- remember Walter Lewin!
- The reason this is effective is **"EMPATHETIC MIRRORING"**
- Create events to make the talk memorable
  - break a prop
  - burn something

    
### Preparing & Reviewing
- Preparing for Oral Exams
    - Get friends who nothing about the topic to review
    - "If you can't make me cry, I won't value as a friend anymore!"
    - People who know what you're talking about, like your faculty advisor hallucinated that there is stuff in the talk that actually isn't


### Job Talks
- Showcase a vision
  - problem that people care about
  - your novel approach
- Showcase that you've done stuff 
  - Listing the steps that need to be taken in order to achieve a solution to the above problem
  - You don't need to have done everything already
  - "Here's what needs to be done."
  - Enumerate your contributions
- All in 5 minutes

### Getting Famous/ the recognition you deserve
- "Your ideas are like your children, you don't want them to go into the world in rags"
- Let them get recognised fot their value
- to get remembered, 
  - make sure you have a **SYMBOl** associated with your presentation
  - a **SLOGAN**
  - a **SURPRISE**
  - a **SALIENT IDEA**
    - an idea that sticks out, not necessarily the most important
  - the **STORY** of how you did it
  
### How to Stop
- FInal Slide: not to have
  - Collaborators: Put that slide towards the beginning of the talk
  - Questions: waste of real estate and opportunity to show who you are
  - website: waste of opportunity, does nothing for you
  - "THE END" :lol:
  - Thank You: Did the people stay out of politeness?
  
- Final Slide: to have
  - Conclusions
  - Contributions

- Tell a joke! People are ready and receptive for a joke!
  - That way people think they had fun the whole time
- Salute the audience: 
  - Speak good about the audience.
  - Tell what you want them to do, etc.
