### Premise:
<div class=text-justify> 

It might seem intuitive to use Google Maps to look at public transport schedules in cities. But services to the suburbs and rural flanks of metros are still not captured digitally.
When I moved to an apartment in the suburbs, this was one tiny inconvenience. My solution was to simply capture the time, direction and location of these 'Small Bus' services on a Google Sheet whenever I spotted one on the road. 
In two weeks I was able to predict the arrival of a bus at a given time quite reliably. This met my requirements. But I'd need to recreate the schedule if it were to be useful to everyone in the neighbourhood.
