summary: Steven Weinberg's Advice to Students at the start of their Scientific Careers

"I think we don't take our theories seriously enough, because it's so hard to believe that the squiggles that you make on a piece of paper are actually the way nature works."

4 Lessons:

1. In  my  first  year  of graduate school, I  had  the  good  luck  to  fall  into  the hands of senior physicists who insisted that  I  must  start doing  research, and  pick  up  what  I  needed to  know  as  I  went  along.  To  my  surprise, I  found  that  this works. I  managed  to  get  a  quick  PhD  — though when I got it I knew almost nothing about physics. But I did learn one big thing: that  no  one  knows  everything, and you don’t have to.
2. While you are swimming and not sinking you should  aim  for  rough  water. My advice is to go for the messes —  that’s where the action is. 	
3. Forgive  yourself for wasting  time. In  the  real world, it’s very hard to know which problems are important, and most of the time that you spend in the laboratory or at your desk will be wasted. If you want  to be creative, then you will have to get used to  spending  most  of your  time  not  being   creative, to being becalmed on the ocean of scientific knowledge.
4.  Learn something about the history of science, or at a minimum the history of your own  branch  of science. As  a  scientist, you’re  probably  not going to get rich. Your friends and relatives probably won’t understand what you’re doing. But  you  can  get  great satisfaction by recognizing that your work in science is a part of history.
