title: SAE Short Course on Aero Design
event: CET SAE Collegiate Chapter
#event_url: https://example.org

#location: Source Themes HQ

#address:
  #street: 450 Serra Mall

summary: One-day Short Course for engineering students from all over Kerala, India. 
abstract: "The process of designing aerodynamic structures is inherently iterative. This course is intended for the beginner who wishes to understand the math, theory, history and experimental steps in the design of an optimised airfoil. At the end of the course, the students tests a NACA0012 airfoil in the Subsonic wind tunnel at College of Engineering Trivandrum, and compare measured pressure distribution data with their CFD results."

#Slides can be added in a few ways:

#- **Create** slides using Academic's [*Slides*](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
#- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
#- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/writing-markdown-latex/).

#Further talk details can easily be added to this page using *Markdown* and $\rm \LaTeX$ math code.
