title: "On Tread Patterns: Parameterisation and Inverse Design"
#event: CET, 2016
#event_url: https://example.org

#location: College of Engineering Trivandrum

#address:
  #street: 450 Serra Mall

summary: ""
abstract: "Design of tread patterns have conventionally been an iterative process. An inverse design procedure is proposed based on basic mechanics of solids and modelling of interfacial kinematics at the contact patch for radial tyres."

A novel method for the inverse design of tyre tread patterns is presented. This method which makes use of structural and geometric analysis is particularly useful in the designing of passenger car and bus/truck radial tyres.
