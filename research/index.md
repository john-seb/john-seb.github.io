# Research

My work lies at the intersection of **fluid mechanics**, **soft matter physics**, and **biophysical transport**, with a central focus on how *geometry across scales* governs physical behavior.

A recurring theme in my research is understanding how confinement, curvature, and structural complexity influence transport, force transmission, and system-level response — particularly in microscale and nanoscale systems.

## Geometry-driven transport

I study how surface structure and confinement alter transport phenomena in fluidic systems. This includes reduced-order modeling of nanofluidic systems using electrical-circuit analogies and scaling arguments to connect experiment and theory.

---

## Thin-film hydrodynamics and interfacial mechanics

Thin films act as hydrodynamic barriers where dissipation increases dramatically as film thickness decreases. Understanding how particles traverse these barriers informs problems in adhesion, lubrication, and interfacial transport.

---

## Frugal microfluidics and sensing

I am interested in physics-driven device design, especially for low-cost and field-deployable systems. One direction involves electrical impedance methods for detecting microplastics in inland water systems.

---

## Broader objective

Across these projects, my goal is to connect:

- Geometry → Governing equations  
- Governing equations → Reduced-order models  
- Reduced-order models → Practical devices  

By identifying how structure encodes physics, we can design simpler, more robust systems for sensing, transport control, and materials engineering.
