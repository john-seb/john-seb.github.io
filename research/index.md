# Research

My work sits at the intersection of **fluid mechanics** and **soft-matter / (bio)physics**, with an emphasis on how **geometry across scales** (from macro to nano) governs transport, forces, and function. Over the past several years, a common thread has been connecting *shape* to *physics* in systems ranging from nanofluidic devices to aerodynamic/hydrodynamic surfaces and flexible/architectured materials. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## Themes

### Geometry-driven transport at small scales
I’m interested in how confinement and surface geometry change the governing physics—e.g., effective resistance, interfacial forces, and nonlinear responses in **nanofluidic systems** and microstructured channels. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

### Interfacial flows and thin films
Thin films often act like “hydrodynamic barriers,” where dissipation can diverge as thickness decreases. This shows up in both engineered and biological settings, and motivates simplified (but predictive) models based on lubrication theory. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

### Frugal microfluidics and field-deployable diagnostics
I like problems where the physics is elegant *and* the constraints are real: low cost, minimal infrastructure, and robust sensing. One example direction is using **electrical impedance** to detect microplastics in inland waters. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

## Selected work (examples)

### Traversing a thin lubricant film in finite time
A study of how particles overcome a thin-film hydrodynamic barrier to make contact—relevant for processes like docking/catalysis and engineered particulate interactions. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

### Electrical-circuit modeling of nanofluidic systems
Using circuit analogies to make complex nanoscale transport easier to reason about and to connect experiments to reduced-order models. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

### Detection of microplastics in inland waters using impedance spectroscopy
A frugal-device direction aimed at identifying microplastics that often go undetected in water samples, leveraging simple electrical measurements. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

## Methods & tools
Depending on the question, I combine:
- reduced-order modeling (scaling laws, circuit analogs, lubrication approximations),
- experimental prototyping (microfluidic and soft-matter systems),
- and computational workflows for data reduction and model fitting.

## What I’m exploring now
Broadly: **how geometry encodes physics**, and how to exploit that for (i) better mechanistic understanding and (ii) simpler, more robust devices.
