# Research

My work sits at the intersection of **fluid mechanics**, **soft matter**, and **biophysical transport**, with a focus on how **geometry across scales** governs physical behavior.

## Themes

### Geometry-driven transport
I study how confinement and surface structure change transport and forces, especially in micro/nanofluidic systems.

### Thin-film hydrodynamics and interfaces
Thin lubricant films can act as strong hydrodynamic barriers. I’m interested in the scaling laws and reduced models that predict when and how particles traverse such barriers.

### Frugal microfluidics and sensing
I also like physics-first, fieldable device ideas—where constraints (cost, power, robustness) shape the design.

## What I’m exploring now
Broadly: **how geometry encodes physics**, and how to exploit that in both mechanistic models and simple devices.
